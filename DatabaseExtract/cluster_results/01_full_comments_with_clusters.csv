Ray says that if the buyer defaults on his debt the bar tender doesn't make money, but that is not true. The bank puts the dollars in the bar tenders account right away. The bank is the one that gets stuck with the burden of losing money when a borrower can't pay. This obviously doesn't change the fact that one persons debt is another's income and then spending is going to decrease as a result of people not being able to pay. So what would be good to add to this is exactly who and what was ""wrong"" when he mentions that ""people"" thought ""wealth/assets"" were money, but they were really credit (during minute 24). Because my understanding is that it is only the bank and other major lenders that were wrong about wealth really being credit, maybe also stock market investors, but I have a feeling there is a much better answer that I cannot find.",2025-12-24T17:27:15Z,1,False,0,-0.4399,-1,-1,0,Casual Viewer,9

Firstly purchasing a house is a transaction. Generally one that requires lending. The Lender is generally the bank. To acquire this lending requires you to be credit worthy. Becoming credit worthy means proving that you are a low risk borrower who is likely to repay on time. To meet these requirements you need the following... A strong credit history, A history of managing debt responsibly, A stable income, And the initial deposit saved from your own (blood, sweat and tears). Only then will the bank look at you favourable for lending. Once all of these boxes have been ticked you are happy because now you can finally purchase a house! (Yippee) which leads us to answering your question. Wtf is the bank actually producing? The bank is producing credit to you and a Financial Asset to them. Basically a claim to future money from you. This all falls under the umbrella of how the economy works, so its not necessarily the banks fault that we want to live in our own homes 30 years before we can actually afford too, its ours. And the system has been put in place for this purpose. The alternative is you can always save up that $500,000 and pay for the house outright but by the time you get to saving that $500,000 the house is now valued at $900,000 lol.
